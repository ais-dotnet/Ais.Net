# Error handling strategy

## Status

Established. (The practices were in place by the time we started adding ADRs.)

## Context

NMEA messages containing AIS data are sometimes malformed. The messages are often transferred from transponder devices to computer equipment over a serial port, which have limited error detection and correction capabilities, making it possible for messages to lose characters or contain garbage characters.

## Decision

We deal with malformed NMEA messages at two levels.

The `NmeaLineParser` detects failures to conform to the basic structure required of an NMEA message. It reports these errors by throwing an `ArgumentException` with a text message describing the way in which the message structure does not match the specification. For example, if the normal `!` start character is missing, the error message is `Invalid data. Expected '!' at sentence start`. In cases where the message is well formed but with features that Ais.Net cannot currently parse, we throw a `NotSupportedException` exception.

Code that processes large numbers of messages will typically not construct the `NmeaLineParser` itself, and instead relies on the high-throughput methods offered by `NmeaStreamParser`. Code working this way passes in an implementation of either `INmeaLineStreamProcessor` or `INmeaAisMessageStreamProcessor` depending on whether it wants to process each line in the file directly, or it wants `NmeaStreamParser` to handle the task of reassembling AIS payloads that have been fragmented across multiple NMEA message lines. Both of these interfaces require an `OnError` method that looks like this:

```csharp
void OnError(in ReadOnlySpan<byte> line, Exception error, int lineNumber);
```

When the `NmeaLineParser` constructed by the `NmeaStreamParser` reports an error in the manner described above, the exception it throws will be passed to this `OnError` method, along with a span providing access to the problematic line's full content, and the line number within the stream at which the error was detected.


## Consequences

The `NmeaLineParser`-level error reporting provides applications with a clear description of what seems to be wrong, helping to diagnose the problem. The stream-level handling makes it possible for high-volume processing code to continue in the face of errors in a data stream.
