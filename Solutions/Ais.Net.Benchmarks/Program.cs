        /// When running in an Azure DevOps pipeline, a couple of things can go wrong with BenchmarkDotNet.
        /// First, by default it puts its output into a path relative to the current working directory,
        /// which will often be some way further up the folder hierarchy than we want. Second, the components
        /// under test will have been built with a /p:Version=x.y.z argument, setting the version number to
        /// whatever the build process has determined it should be. That can be problematic because
        /// BenchmarkDotNet rebuilds various elements for each benchmark, meaning everything would default back
        /// to v1.0.0.0. However, that seems to cause problems because the hosting benchmark project will
        /// have been build against the correct version number. This shouldn't be a problem because the
        /// benchmarks all run isolated, but weirdly, we get an error *after* the benchmarking is complete,
        /// causing this hosting program to exit with an error.
        /// </p>
