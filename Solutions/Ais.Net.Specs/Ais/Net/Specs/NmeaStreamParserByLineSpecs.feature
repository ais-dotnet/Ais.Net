Feature: NmeaStreamParserSpecs
	In order to process AIS messages in NMEA files
	As a developer
	I want to be able to process each of the lines in an NMEA file

Scenario: Empty file
	Given no content
	When I parse the content by line
	Then INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnComplete should have been called
    And INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnNext should have been called 0 times

Scenario: Single CRLF blank line only
	Given a CRLF line ''
	When I parse the content by line
    Then INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnNext should have been called 0 times
	And INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnComplete should have been called

Scenario: Single LF blank line only
	Given a line ''
	When I parse the content by line
    Then INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnNext should have been called 0 times
	And INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnComplete should have been called

Scenario: Multiple CRLF blank lines only
	Given a CRLF line ''
	And a CRLF line ''
	And a CRLF line ''
	When I parse the content by line
    Then INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnNext should have been called 0 times
	And INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnComplete should have been called

Scenario: Multiple LF blank lines only
	Given a line ''
	And a line ''
	And a line ''
	When I parse the content by line
    Then INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnNext should have been called 0 times
	And INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnComplete should have been called

Scenario: Multiple mixed blank lines only
	Given a CRLF line ''
	And a line ''
	And a CRLF line ''
	When I parse the content by line
    Then INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnNext should have been called 0 times
	And INmeaLineStreamProcessor.OnComplete should have been called

Scenario: Single line
