Feature: NmeaLineToAisStreamAdapterSpecs
	In order to process the AIS messages in NMEA files
	As a developer
	I want to be able to receive complete AIS message payloads even when they are split over multiple NMEA lines

Scenario: Non-fragmented message received
	# ais.kystverket.no
	When the line to message adapter receives '\s:42,c:1567684904*38\!AIVDM,1,1,,B,33m9UtPP@50wwE:VJW6LS67H01<@,0*3C'
	Then INmeaAisMessageStreamProcessor.OnNext should have been called 1 time
    And in ais message 0 the payload should be '33m9UtPP@50wwE:VJW6LS67H01<@' with padding of 0
    And in ais message 0 the source from the first NMEA line should be 42
    And in ais message 0 the timestamp from the first NMEA line should be 1567684904

Scenario: First fragment of two-part message received
	# ais.kystverket.no
